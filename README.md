# DIP (Design In Programming)
# HTML document design service for general users who don't know HTML

It is a tool that helps people who have no knowledge of HTML and CSS format to design HTML documents.

All elements are organized on a per-component basis, and if you drag and drop components(ui elements), you can complete an HTML document without coding.

You can stop and edit your HTML documents at any time.

When the design is finished, the HTML document can be extracted.
